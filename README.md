### Tools, Tweaks, random stuff I want to try

Dead:

* timeit- to time how long a command runs
* latex_compilation- commands to compile latex files on system
* vimrc- vim config file, uses vim plug plugin
* bashrc- bash config file

Gotta kill:

* Python scraping tool to collect PhD notifications from Twitter
* Multiple copy, paste tool
* Zotero CLI
* Auto Login for UoH
* Word embeddings embedded with common sense
* Writable but undeletable files
* Harry Potter text generation
* cursor control on commands
* Inktober with Robotic Arm
